# TwitterSearchAPI
This is a small library repository of how we can search and save Tweets from Twitter without using their official API. The code is suitable to be built as a library and included as a maven artifact as well.

``` console
gradle clean install
```

The URL has been changed to the current url Twitter-Search also we can change the url without changing the code (sending a new parameter to the search method). The example's in the repository "test-twitter-search".

In addition, user information has written the tweet is obtained.
